# panelapp_queries
Coding projects to query data in PanelApp

Current aims (24/05/17):

1. PanelApp Query to return all current versions of panels within PanelApp and status of all genes within each panel
  - this will then be used to create a pie chart for all green/amber/red/unknown status genes currently
  - documentation for script(s)

2. PanelApp Query to return all versions of all panels, with status of all genes within each version
  - this will then be used to create a bar chart over time plotting the additions/subtractions of genes for a/each panel
  - documetation for script(s)
